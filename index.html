                    succeed in life.</p>

                    <p>Even if it’s a little thing, do something for those who have need of a man’s help– something for
                        which you get no pay but the privilege of doing it. For, remember, you don’t live in a world all
                        your own. Your brothers are here, too</p>

                    <p>I believe that we all have a responsibility to give back. No one becomes successful without lots
                        of hard work, support from others, and a little luck. Giving back creates a virtuous cycle that
                        makes everyone more successful.</p>

                    <h3>Education for a child</h3>
                    <p>I believe giving back is one of the greatest life lessons we can teach our children: that the
                        world isn’t all about them and that, through our actions, people will really discover what kind
                        of person we truly are. </p>
